# Shared knowledge

This is **Trickplayer** — the Even Realities G2 build of Trickplayer, one of three
implementations of the same product:

| Repo | Platform |
|---|---|
| `trickplayer-g2` | Even Realities G2 |
| `trickplayer-pebble` | Pebble Time 2 |
| `trickplayer-wearos` | Wear OS |

Findings that are not specific to Even Realities G2 live in **`trickplayer-knowledge`**,
not here.

## The rule

A non-obvious discovery gets a `findings/` entry in `trickplayer-knowledge`,
with the per-platform *applies / status* table filled in, **before the PR that
acts on it merges**.

"Does not apply to Pebble, because X" is a complete answer and takes ten
seconds. Silence is what costs six months — see `PLAN.md` §2 for the three
corrections that sat in one repo's comments while the other two shipped the bug.

## What belongs where

**`trickplayer-knowledge`** — the rules, and the conformance corpus that
enforces them: trick-play index parsing, SRT parsing and cue-window ownership,
scene selection policy, cursor semantics, the media-source contract.

**Here** — everything shaped by this platform's constraints: the image pipeline,
the transport, the trigger model, layout, and config UI. Those are genuinely
different across the three and are not worth unifying.

## Vocabulary

Domain terms are standardized across all three repos. `Timeline` (not
`BifIndex`), `FrameRef`, `timelineRef`, `itemId`, `subtitleRef`, `scene`
(not `chunk`). See `PLAN.md` §7, Phase 0.

## Conformance corpus

`corpus/` is **vendored** from `trickplayer-knowledge` — never edit it here.
Refresh it by running that repo's `tools/corpus/sync-corpus.sh`, which also has
a `--check` mode that reports drift.

```bash
npm run conformance
```

**This currently fails, on purpose.** It reports the three divergences already
documented in `PLAN.md` §3, rather than hiding them:

| Check | Expected | This build |
|---|---|---|
| `timeline multiplier` | 500 (the value in the file) | 1000 — hardcoded, so every timestamp is doubled |
| `timeline trailing` | last frame 70 B (from the sentinel) | 107 B — derived from the buffer length |
| `subs cues` | `Italic dialogue.` | `<i>Italic dialogue.</i>` — tags and `{\an8}` not stripped |

Fixing them is `PLAN.md` Phase 2, items 11 and 12. Until then a red run here is
the accurate state of this build, and the runner exists so it is visible rather
than a note in a document nobody re-reads.

Testing the parser headlessly is possible only because `src/timeline.ts` is
split into a pure `parseTimelineIndex` and a browser layer that adds Blobs and
object URLs — `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL` do not exist under Node, and
previously they were entangled with the parsing.
